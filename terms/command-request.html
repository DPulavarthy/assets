                        The requested commands should not be a currently existing command, to see a full list of
                        currently
                        active commands on Jonin use the `//help full` command to get messages with the full command
                        list
                        directly messaged to you by Jonin.
                        <br />
                        If we<sup>1</sup> decide to repurpose or improve upon an existing command to meet the
                        requirements,
                        it will count as your<sup>2</sup> request.
                        <br />
                        The requested command will be made in JavaScript (JS)
                        <br />
                        The requested command must be directed to be safe for work (SFW), a safe for work command should
                        not
                        contain content that is illegal or directed to have content that involves info that should not
                        be
                        available to users under the average legal age.
                        <br />
                        Not safe for work (NSFW) commands will NOT be accepted, unless approved by an owner<sup>3</sup>,
                        this command does allow content that should not be available to users under the average legal
                        age,
                        but still cannot have content that is illegal.
                        <br />
                        If we<sup>1</sup> decide to reject the requested command, you<sup>2</sup> can use the request
                        for a
                        different command, in this case the new command should still follow the rules stated in this
                        guidelines.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> hold the right to remove the requested command if necessary or requested by
                        you<sup>2</sup>.
                        <br />
                        If the command is held illegal, it will be removed/rejected and we<sup>1</sup> will contact the
                        required authorities, and are not held liable to your<sup>2</sup> actions.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> hold the right to ask why your request has been rejected in the circumstance
                        that it
                        happens.
                        <br />
                        Once a command is successfully operational, if it is later decided to be removed you may not
                        request
                        another command unless your server is in partnership and follows the partnership guidelines.
                        <br />
                        If a command request is not seen to be properly requested or badly worded, we<sup>1</sup> are
                        not
                        liable to the final version and can remove the command if it is not seen fit.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> wish to remove or temporarily disable their requested command, they will have
                        the
                        right to do so.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> do not have any rights over the requested command or Jonin other than the ones
                        listed in these guidelines.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> do not join the support server (Jonin Support), it will be used as a reason
                        to
                        reject a command request.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> leave the support server (Jonin Support), it implies that full control over
                        the
                        command is given to us<sup>1</sup>.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> are removed from the support server (Jonin Support) due to a break in the
                        rules,
                        it is implied that full control over the command is given to us<sup>1</sup>.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> hold the power to transfer the requested command to a different user, which does
                        not
                        give you the power to request another command unless your server is in partnership and follows
                        the
                        partnership guidelines.
                        <br />
                        If a command is removed once successfully operational, you<sup>2</sup> must directly contact the
                        owners<sup>3</sup> or email dev@jonin.gq for a request for re-approval.
                        <br />
                        If any rule in this Command guidelines is broken by you<sup>2</sup>, it implies that
                        you<sup>2</sup>
                        are giving us<sup>1</sup> full access to the command and that you will take full responsibility
                        for
                        any allegations held against us<sup>1</sup>.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> can request improvements to the requested command and will not require another
                        command request as long as the modification does not change the purpose of the command.
                        <br />
                        Any help or questions should be directed to the owners<sup>3</sup> or emailed to
                        support@jonin.gq.
                        <br />
                        If we<sup>1</sup> fail to respond or decide not to accept a request, we<sup>1</sup> are not held
                        liable.
                        <br />
                        If a command is requested through the website jonin.gq, then the terms of use, terms and
                        conditions,
                        and privacy policy all apply you<sup>2</sup> and must be followed for the command request to be
                        queued for approval.
                        <br />
                        If this command is later seen to be misused, we<sup>1</sup> have the right to remove or revoke
                        access by you<sup>2</sup>, this includes giving us<sup>1</sup> full access to the command.
                        <br />
                        By following this guideline you<sup>2</sup> are giving us<sup>1</sup> the right to track and
                        manage
                        the requested command.
                        <br />
                        Tracking a requested command includes the following: command usage, command count, command data,
                        and
                        command content.
                        <br />
                        When requesting a command, you<sup>2</sup> are accepting the fact that the command will be added
                        to
                        Jonin.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> decide to not to accept these guidelines, then you request will not be
                        approved
                        and your request will be nullified.
                        <br />
                        If you<sup>2</sup> do not wish this command to be on Jonin and wish to have a personal bot,
                        please
                        see the Bot Creation Guidelines.
                        <br />

                        The command must follow Discord's Terms of Service, including no selfbot activity or creation of
                        a
                        command that acts as a selfbot, and no directly messaging all users of a group of users in a
                        server.

                        <br />
                        If a command exists and your<sup>2</sup> request to modify the command is not seen as an
