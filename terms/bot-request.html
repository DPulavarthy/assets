                    <p> Last updated: May 22, 2020 </p>
                    <p> Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using our service. </p>

                <div>
                    <p style="color: #C0C0C0;">
                        A payment is required for the creation of a bot, unless negotiated
                        <br />
                        You are agreeing that the bot will be created in JavaScript (JS)
                        <br />
                        The requested bot must be directed to be safe for work (SFW), a safe for work bot should not
                        contain content that is illegal or directed to have content that involves info that should not
                        be available to users under the average legal age.
                        <br />
                        Not safe for work (NSFW) bots will NOT be accepted, unless approved by an owner<sup>3</sup>,
                        this type of bot does allow content that should not be available to users under the average
                        legal age, but still cannot have content that is illegal.
                        <br />
                        If we<sup>1</sup> decide to reject the requested bot, you<sup>2</sup> cannot use this request
                        for another bot.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> hold the right to remove/delete/decline the requested bot if necessary or
                        requested by you<sup>2</sup>.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> hold the right to ask why your<sup>2</sup> request has been rejected in the
                        circumstance that it happens.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> are not in agreement to provide you<sup>2</sup> a hoster, if the bot request
                        requires data to be saved it is not liable to us<sup>1</sup> to find a solution.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> will not provide a database in the instance that it is needed for the bot's
                        function.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> are also agreeing to give us<sup>1</sup> power to control or disable bot.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> have the right to request ownership of the bot due to any reason, this will be
                        treated by case.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> are agreeing to provide us<sup>1</sup> the token for the bot in the instance
                        that it is reset.
                        <br />
                        The bot application must be created on your<sup>2</sup> account, and you<sup>2</sup> must
                        provide us<sup>1</sup> access for the bot to test and develop.
                        <br />
                        A deletion of a bot requires a payment of $50 USD, non-negotiable
                        <br />
                        If your<sup>2</sup> bot is removed or deleted, you<sup>2</sup> cannot request the creation of
                        another bot.
                        <br />
                        If a bot is requested through the website jonin.gq, then the terms of use, terms and conditions,
                        and privacy policy all apply<sup>2</sup> and must be followed for the bot request to be queued
                        for approval.
                        <br />
                        The bot must follow Discord's Terms of Service, including no selfbot activity or creation of a
                        command that acts as a selfbot, and no directly messaging all users of a group of users in a
                        server.
                        <br />
                        We<sup>1</sup> are not liable if you<sup>2</sup> modify the bot's data that causes a loss in
                        data or crash of the bot.
                        <br />
                        You<sup>2</sup> can request improvements to the requested bot and will not require another bot
                        request as long as the modification does not change the purpose of the bot.
                        <br />
                        Any help or questions should be directed to the owners<sup>3</sup> or emailed to
                        support@jonin.gq.
                        <br />
                        If we<sup>1</sup> fail to respond or decide not to accept a request, we<sup>1</sup> are not held
                        liable.
                        <br />

                        If it is found that the bot is being used for illegal purposes, it will be taken down by force

                        <br />
